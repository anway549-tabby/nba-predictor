CLAUDE BUILD BRIEF
NBA Player Props Prediction Platform

PURPOSE
You are an AI engineering agent (Claude). Your task is to design and implement a production-grade NBA player props prediction platform strictly based on deterministic rules. Do not add machine learning, betting odds, or extra features beyond what is specified.
This document is intentionally concise and optimized for AI execution.
---
CORE OBJECTIVE
Build a fully functional web application that allows users to:
1. View historical NBA player stats (last 15 team matches)
2. See deterministic player prop predictions for upcoming matches
3. Internally track prediction accuracy (admin only)
Target user: Sports bettors
Access model: Free, no login
Tone: Betting-adjacent, informational
---
SCOPE
Sport: NBA only
Games: Regular season + playoffs
Predictions allowed only if match starts within 24 hours
If match is >24 hours away, display:
“Predictions coming soon. We are working on updated data.”
Pre-match predictions only. No live or in-game logic.
---
DATA RULES (CRITICAL)
Use the last 15 matches played by the PLAYER’S TEAM.
Include all 15 matches even if the player did not play.
If Minutes = 0:
- Points, Rebounds, Assists must be imputed
- Imputed value = average of matches where Minutes > 0
Player trades:
- Use last 15 games regardless of team
Data refresh:
- Once daily at 12:00 PM IST
- Use all completed games until refresh time
---
FEATURE 1: PLAYER HISTORICAL STATS
Display a table per player with exactly these columns:
Date | Opponent | Minutes | Points | Rebounds | Assists
No additional stats.
---
FEATURE 2: PLAYER PROPS PREDICTION
For each player, output ONE final prop per stat.
POINTS THRESHOLDS:
10+, 15+, 20+, 25+, 30+
REBOUNDS THRESHOLDS:
4+, 6+, 8+, 10+, 12+
ASSISTS THRESHOLDS:
2+, 4+, 6+, 8+, 10+
Threshold interpretation:
15+ means >= 15 (same rule for all stats)
DETERMINISTIC LOGIC:
1. Evaluate thresholds from highest to lowest
2. For each threshold, count matches where stat >= threshold
3. If count >= 14 out of 15 ? select that threshold
4. Output ONLY the highest qualifying threshold
5. If none qualify ? output no prop
Missed matches use imputed averages and count fully.
If player is ruled OUT:
- Show label: “Not Expected to Play”
- Disable prediction for that player
---
FEATURE 3: ACCURACY TRACKING (ADMIN ONLY)
After match completion:
- Compare actual stat vs predicted threshold
- If actual >= predicted ? HIT
- Else ? MISS
Store accuracy per:
Match | Player | Stat | Prediction | Actual | Result
Accuracy is NOT shown to users.
---
UI REQUIREMENTS
Platform: Fully responsive web
Layout: Table-based
User actions:
- Select date
- Select match
- Sort players by predicted prop value
No login, no personalization.
---
DATA SOURCES
Use an open or free NBA data source providing:
- Match schedules
- Player game logs
- Team rosters
- Player status (injury / out)
Source selection is up to you.
---
STRICT RULES FOR CLAUDE
- Do NOT introduce machine learning
- Do NOT add confidence scores
- Do NOT change thresholds
- Do NOT add betting odds
- Do NOT optimize logic beyond what is stated
Build clean, modular, extensible code so ML can be added later.
---
DELIVERABLES EXPECTED
1. System architecture
2. Database schema
3. Backend APIs
4. Data ingestion pipeline
5. Prediction engine implementation
6. Accuracy tracking mechanism
